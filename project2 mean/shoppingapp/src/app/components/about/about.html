<div class="about-container">
  <p>
    Welcome to <b>ShoppingAPI</b> â€” your one-stop solution for managing products easily.  
    This application is built to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 
    on product data using Angular and Node.js with MongoDB.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our goal is to provide a simple, clean, and professional interface where users can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Add new products</li>
    <li>Update product details</li>
    <li>Delete products</li>
    <li>View all products in a structured table</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This project is designed as a learning tool and can be extended to build 
    real-world e-commerce platforms.
